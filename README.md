A calculator designed to assist in solving math problems related to speed, time, and distance. It consists of two modules:
- Speed calculator
- Two-trains problem calculator

## Speed Calculator
A calculator for speed, time, and distance. It allows you to calculate speed, time, or distance based on the provided data. You need to input two out of the three values: speed, time, or distance.  
It also supports unit conversion for speed, time, and distance.

## Two-Train Problem Calculator
A calculator for problems like: A train from town A to town B travels at a speed of 150 km/h. A train from town B to town A travels at a speed of 85 km/h. The distance between town A and town B is 300 km. After how much time will they meet, and at what distance from town A?  
The results are displayed on a diagram showing the distances of the trains from towns A and B, as well as the time of their meeting.
